## Asumptions & Simplifications
- Infinite deck: Cards are drawn with constant probability (no deck tracking or shuffling)
- Limited actions: Only Hit and Stand are available (no Split, Double Down, or Insurance)
- Client-side gameplay: Game logic runs on the client; only chips and history sync with server
- Refresh handling: If a player refreshes during an active game, the bet is not loss since games are only saved when completed
- Dealer visibility: Dealer shows only one card initially (standard casino rules)
